I soon began my career transition, and it has been a journey replete with pleasant surprises and moments more fulfilling than any previous. \nThe pickup basketball games, the late night 888 food runs, the adventures on 6th, and deep talks with my roommates are moments I will miss dearly (except waking up for class). UT helped me grow as a student but also helped me become a better and more mature person.\nThank you Mom and Dad, and Hook 'em ðŸ¤˜."
